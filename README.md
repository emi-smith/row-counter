## Description
A simple row counter app to keep track of rows when knitting or crocheting. The purpose of this project was to practice reassigning, incrementing, decrementing, using functions to write less code, displaying count, working with the DOM, string concatenation, and converting a string into a number to complete simple math.

## What-I-enjoyed
This was a fun and quick project to build, I would like to build on this project in the future as I learn more advanced JavaScript skills.

## Issues-and-future-changes
Issues I came across during the build:
     Converting a string to a number to add the new row count to the saved row count. After doing some research I was able to use parseInt(str) in my saveTotal functions to convert the string to a number to save the total row count.

Features that will be added in the future:
     - Save data to local storage
     - Add additional functions to allow users to keep a project catalog and project count history.
     - Allow user to add a project name and project photos under each project.
     - Allow users to keep notes under each project
     - Allow users to track time spend on each project.
